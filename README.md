streetmix-router
================

This is a quick-and-dirty project that implements a simple HTTP proxy using Node.js's [request library](https://github.com/mikeal/request) and [streams functionality](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html). It is meant for deployment on a PaaS provider such as [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

In the longer run, this project may go away and be replaced by something like [Apache Traffic Server](http://trafficserver.apache.org/) running on an [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/) [EC2](http://www.amazon.com/ec2/) instance.
